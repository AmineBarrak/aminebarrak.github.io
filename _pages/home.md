**I am Amine Barrak**, an Assistant Professor at [Oakland University](https://www.oakland.edu/). I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the from the [University of Quebec](https://www.uqac.ca), specifically from the [Department of Computer Science and Mathematics](https://www.uqac.ca/dim/). My research focuses on adapting **distributed training** in machine learning to **function-as-a-service (FaaS)** infrastructure.

## Research Interests

- **Distributed ML Architectures**
- **Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and Cloud Computing**
- **Software Engineering for ML (SE4ML)**
- **MLOps and ML Pipeline**
- **Secure Machine Learning**
- **Parallel Algorithms**



For details about my research, please check my [publication list](publications.md).


I obtained my **research master's** at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/), where I applied machine learning techniques to detect **vulnerabilities** in source code. My work was inspired by concerns over unintentional privilege protection changes that could introduce **security vulnerabilities** and expose sensitive data. My master's thesis won the [Best Student Paper Award](https://www.unb.ca/fredericton/cs/_assets/documents/cas-atlantic/cascon-2018.pdf). This work was supervised by [Foutse Khomh](https://khomh.net/). As a research assistant with [Bram Adams](https://mcis.cs.queensu.ca/bram.html), I contributed to **continuous integration** and **machine learning pipelines**, analyzing source code and build failures while working on the **traceability** of **ML and source code artifacts**.

I completed my engineering degree in Tunisia at the [Higher Institute of Informatics](http://www.isi.rnu.tn/), where I earned a **government scholarship** based on my exceptional academic achievements, enabling me to pursue studies in Canada.
